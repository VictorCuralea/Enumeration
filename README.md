# Enumeration Scripts
- s3buckets.txt - an example list of open S3 buckets! URLs that looks like: http://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKETNAME/ are totally useless. You need subdomains
- s3enum.py - The S3 Bucket Enumerator! Example usage: python script.py sitelist.txt. For example: python s3enum.py s3list
- s3list - the output of top-1m.csv when used with regex.py
- top-1m.csv - Alexa's Top 1 Million Sites. Don't ask how I got this ;D
- regex.py - Simple regex script that I made to parse the Alexa Top 1 Million Sites file
